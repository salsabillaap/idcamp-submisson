                <h2>Why Thrifting?</h2>
                <h3>THRIFTING IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.</h3>
                <img src="assets submission/image/environment.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Shop with purpose. Thrifting is gentler on the environment by reducing pollution and waste. The average American throws away 81 pounds of clothes PER YEAR. That adds up to around 26 BILLION pounds of clothing going right to landfills. Thrifting is recycling. Point blank. By choosing preloved items over newly produced pieces, you're shrinking your carbon footprint. You're limiting the amount of natural resources it takes to create new fabric, make the clothing, and ship it hundreds or thousands of miles to the store. Giving a used item new life rescues it from those 26 billion pounds going to the landfill by keeping it in circulation. And when you're done with it, you can donate it again for someone else to find and love. It's a gift that keeps giving. </p>
                <h3>THRIFTING IS GOOD FOR YOUR WALLET.</h3>
                <img src="assets submission/image/money.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Most thrift stores offer extremely low prices compared to their retail counterparts. It's common sense that the more money you can save, the better off you'll be. There's no feeling that's more rewarding than scoring an awesome secondhand jewel for a fraction of its original cost. Despite being less expensive, secondhand items are often actually better quality than new ones. It's a good sign if it's so durable that it lasted long enough to be donated. The longer it lasts, the longer it stays out of the landfill.</p>
                <h3>THRIFTING IS GOOD FOR YOUR WARDROBE.</h3>
                <img src="assets submission/image/wardrobe.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Unleash your creativity. Create your own unique style. Stand out from the crowd. You have to get creative and think outside the box when you shop secondhand. It's an exciting challenge to style something old to look new. You'll find one-of-a-kind pieces for your closet or your home. They each tell a story and have a unique, mysterious history. And good news: vintage is IN. Trends cycle in and out of style, which means there thrift stores are chock full of treasures that are good for the environment and great for your aesthetic. </p>
